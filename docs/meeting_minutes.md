### General Info
* New SMT-LIB benchmarks: non-incremental: https://zenodo.org/records/15493090
* Let's all use the latest stable version, Z3-4.15.0: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/tag/z3-4.15.0
* Thursday 8:00am EDT

### To-Dos
#### John
* Complete parallel strategy synthesis in 2-3 days
* Write docs for how to do the synthesis
* Review the new evaluator

#### Jiahao
* Change the arguments/logics: specify per-process core & memory requirement, instead of batch size
* Check whether the new evaluation works correctly with parallel strategies
* Node-level parallelization (less priority)

#### Paul
* Look into tactic/parameter pools for some interesting logics

### Agenda
* (John) I was invited by Joel to make a presentation about Z3alpha at [MOSCA](https://mosca2025.github.io/).
  I want make this talk more focusing on strings, especially what tactics and parameters work better on
  what families, etc, and maybe incorporate a bit about our recent progress on parallel and ML theory.
  We can discuss what are be done in this ~2 months and about potential future publication.
