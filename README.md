Z3alpha synthesizes efficient Z3 strategies tailored to your problem set! See our IJCAI'24 paper [Layered and Staged Monte Carlo Tree Search for SMT Strategy Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17159) for technical details. 

Our tool is built on top of Z3 SMT solver (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). The experiments in our IJCAI'24 paper are based on Z3 4.12.2.

# Prerequisites

The only environmental prerequisites are Z3 and its Python binding (Z3Py). After installing Z3 from the [Z3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), verify the setup:

**Z3 Executable**

Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  z3 -h
  ```

If you see the help message, Z3 is installed correctly. If not, add Z3 to your system's PATH.

**Z3Py**

In a Python environment, check the Z3 Python binding (Z3Py):
```python
try:
    import z3
except ImportError:
    raise Exception("Z3 Python binding not found.")
```
If no errors occur, Z3Py is ready for use.

# A Synthesis Example

Here, we provide an example of synthesizing a tailored Z3 strategy for a toy benchmark set `benchmarks/small`. The `synthesize_full.py` script performs the staged MCTS, which takes a configuraiton JSON file as an argument. The configuration file specifies settings such as the MCTS simulation number, training datasets, timeouts, etc. The configuraiton file this toy example is provied at `experiments/syn_configs/sample.json`. 

The command for this toy exmaple is as follows:

```bash
$ python ./synthesize_full.py experiments/syn_configs/sample.json
```

After this command terminates, the synthesized strategy is saved to a result directory under `experiments/results/`, along with the logs (if enabled). The result directory is named as `out-<starting time:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S>`.

# IJCAI-24 Experiment Data
We have included all experimental result data in `ijcai24_data/`. For each experiment, there is a subfolder (e.g., `ijcai24_data/QF_BV/core/`) containing all competing solvers' testing statistics and sample Z3alpha and FastSMT synthesized strategies. The experiments were conducted on a high-performance CentOS 7 cluster equipped with Intel E5-2683 v4 (Broadwell) processors running at 2.10 GHz.

# Reproduce IJCAI-24 Experiments

### Benchmark Download
Navigate to the `benchmarks/` directory and run the corresponding benchmark downloading script for each experiment. For example, to download the original FastSMT benchmarks for the experiments in Section 5.3, run:

```bash
$ ./download_fastsmt_benchmarks.sh
```
Note: the previous script for downloading SMT-LIB benchmarks from the official GitLab is not working now due to the SMT-LIB organizers changing the storage location of the SMT-LIB benchmarks from GitLab to Zenodo. We will update the downloading script soon.

### Z3alpha Strategy Synthesis

We provide sample configuration JSON files for the experiments in `experiments/syn_configs/`. When under the repository root, run the `synthesize_full.py` script with the corresponding configuration file to start the synthesis. For example, to synthesize a strategy for *leipzig*, run:

```bash
$ python ./synthesize_full.py experiments/syn_configs/leipzig.json
```

Before running the script, ensure to adjust the JSON configuration file to match your computer's specifications.

### Competing Solvers

**FastSMT**

For installation and operation of FastSMT, please refer to the guidance available in the [FastSMT GitHub repository](https://fastsmt.ethz.ch/). In our IJCAI experiemnts, minor modifications to FastSMT are made to facilitate its compatibility with Z3 4.12.2. We have also updated the tactic and parameter canadidates for each tested SMT logic.

**CVC5**

Please check the [CVC5 webpage](https://cvc5.github.io/) for installation and operation instructions. We use CVC5-1.0.5 as one baseline solver in our experiments. 

### Evaluation

We provide the script `scripts/exp_tester.py` for evaluating solvers and strategies. Sample configuration files for evaluating our synthesized strategies are provided in `experiments/eva_configs/`. For example, to evaluate all solvers on the *leipzig* test, run:

```bash
$ python scripts/exp_tester.py experiments/eva_configs/leipzig.json
```

The evaluation outcomes are saved in the directory specified by the `res_dir` entry in the configuration JSON file.
